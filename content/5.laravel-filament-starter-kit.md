## 📦 Installation

```bash
laravel new example-app --using=pepperfm/laravel-filament-starter-kit
```
After creating your project, an interactive setup will ask if you want to automatically build and launch the app using Sail.

✅ If you accept, the following steps will run for you automatically.

❌ If you decline, run them manually:
```bash
chmod 755 ./sail
./sail up -d --build
./sail composer install
./sail artisan key:gen
./sail artisan sto:li
```

## ⚙️ Setup Command

After the initial project installation, the `starter:setup` command runs automatically (or can be run manually anytime) to help you install optional features such as API support, Telegram bot integration, and the Ray debugger.
It will prompt you to select desired packages and handle their installation, as well as configure your environment variables like `WWWUSER` and `WWWGROUP`.

This interactive command will prompt you to select which features you'd like to enable:
- **API Support** — installs packages for API responses, data handling, and Swagger docs
- **Telegram** Bot Integration — installs Telegraph package for easy Telegram bot support
- **Ray Debugger** — installs Spatie Ray for advanced debugging (requires a license)

It will also help you configure your `.env` file with correct `WWWUSER` and `WWWGROUP` values, either by auto-detection or manual input, to ensure correct file permissions when using Sail.

Finally, it runs several post-setup commands such as:
- Setting executable permissions on `./sail`
- Building and starting Sail containers
- Installing Composer dependencies
- Generating application key
- Running custom artisan commands
