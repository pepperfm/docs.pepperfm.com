title: Simple Slim DTO
description: Easily describe your data with minimal boilerplate. No magic, no transformations â€” just pure, readable schema
---

## Problem
Large DTO objects often come with a lot of unnecessary functionality that isn't used or needed for the DTO itself. As a result, we end up with a "Swiss army knife" of an object. But a DTO, at its core, is simply a schema that describes an object, with no extra magic or transformations inside. This is exactly the approach I often look for in my code when managing data.

Currently, in such cases, I use the `sptatie/laravel-data` library, which provides a lot of functionality, but I only use about 10-15% of it. Don't get me wrong, I love the library and recommend it to everyone (it's even on my list of favorites on this site ðŸ˜Œ). It's just that sometimes its functionality is overkill, and all I really want is to describe the object without all the extra complexity. That's where my library comes in.

## Installation

```bash
composer r pepperfm/ssd-for-laravel
```

## Usage

Extends your class from BaseDto and define your data
```php
class ResponseWrapperDto extends BaseDto
{
    public array $data;

    public array $links;

    public array $metaData;
}
```

### Base case
You can create the object like this:
```php
ResponseWrapperDto::make([
    'data' => $response['data'],
    'links' => $response['links'],
    'meta_data' => $response['meta'],
])
```
```php
use Pepperfm\DonationAlerts\Attributes\ToIterable;

class ResponseWrapperDto extends BaseDto
{
    #[ToIterable(ResponseDataDto::class)]
    public array $data;

    public array $links;

    public array $metaData;
}
```
Output:
```php
/**
 * @var array<array-key, ResponseDataDto> $data 
 */
$data = $dto->data;
```

### Extended cases
```php
ResponseWrapperDto::make(literal(
    data: $response['data'],
    links: $response['links'],
    meta: $response['meta'],
))
```
```php
new ResponseWrapperDto(
    data: $response['data'],
    links: $response['links'],
    meta: $response['meta'],
)
```
```php
ResponseWrapperDto::make([
    'data' => $response['data'],
    'links' => $response['links'],
    'meta' => $response['meta'],
])
```
```php
new ResponseWrapperDto([
    'data' => $response['data'],
    'links' => $response['links'],
    'meta' => $response['meta'],
])
```

In this version this package will transform any snake_case variables to camelCase

I started with this because I like this approach
